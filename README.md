# About Me
## My Interests
I began coding when I was 8 years old and have worked with several different languages over the many years I have spent learning, including JS, Rust, Lua, Luau, Java, C++, Python, Ruby, and others. Besides coding, I enjoy rock climbing and playing games. I have a mild interest in wargame models, 3d printing, and painting.
